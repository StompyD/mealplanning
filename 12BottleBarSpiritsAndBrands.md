# 12 Bottle Bar Spirits and Brands

[The 12 Bottle Bar](https://www.amazon.com/12-Bottle-Bar-Bottles-Cocktails/dp/076117494X) by David Solmonson and Lesley Jacobs Solmonson suggests stocking a basic home bar with a limited number of spirits. Written as a response to a cocktail scene that was focusing on niche ingredients and exotic spirits, The 12 Bottle Bar aimed to give readers an affordable way to build a home bar and start experimenting with cocktails at home. 

The 12 Bottle Bar's recommended brands list is especially helpful. Even with inexpensive spirits, a bottle feels like a gamble. (I believe I've had a bottle of sloe gin clogging up our liquor cabinet for 5 years with only 6 ounces missing). Having a shortlist brands helps when navigating unfamiliar spirits. (Malibu rum was the first rum I had at 21. I was scared ever since that all rums were slippery, coconutty messes. I've since learned this isn't true.) I have my own preferences, but this is a solid starting point.
