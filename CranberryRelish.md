## Ingredients 

- 12 ounces fresh cranberries
- 1 orange , with the peel ON
- 1 cup granulated sugar


## Directions
1. Slice the very edge root ends off of the orange, just until you see the flesh. Leave the rest of the skin ON the orange and slice it into 8 pieces.
2. Place the fresh cranberries, orange slices and sugar in your food processor and process until smooth (or until no large chunks remain).
3. Refrigerate until ready to serve (it tastes best after being in the fridge for at least on hour) or for up to 1 week. Serve over turkey, chicken, pork loin etc.
