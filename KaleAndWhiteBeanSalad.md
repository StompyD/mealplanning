Note: Easily doubled (make a full pot of brown rice and buy 3 bags of prechopped kale)

# Ingredients
- 1 cup long grain brown rice 
## VINAIGRETTE
- 1/4 cup olive oil 
- 3 Tbsp red wine vinegar 
- 1/2 Tbsp Dijon mustard 
- 1/2 Tbsp Italian seasoning 
- 1/4 tsp garlic powder 
- 1/4 tsp salt 
- 1/4 tsp freshly cracked black pepper 
## SAUTÉED KALE
- 1/2 lb. chopped fresh kale (6 cups, 1 bag) 
- 1/2 Tbsp cooking oil 
- 1 clove garlic, minced 
- 1/8 tsp salt 
## BOWL TOPPINGS
- 1 15oz. can cannellini beans 
- 1/4 cup sun dried tomatoes 
- 1/4 cup chopped walnuts or almonds
- 2 oz. feta 


# Directions
1. Begin cooking the rice first. The remaining bowl ingredients can be prepared while the rice is cooking. Add the rice and 2 cups water to a saucepot. Place a lid on top and bring the water up to a full boil. Once boiling, turn the heat down to low and let the rice simmer for 40 minutes. After 40 minutes, turn the heat off and let the rice sit with the lid in place for an additional 5 minutes. Fluff just before serving.
2. While the rice is cooking, make the vinaigrette so the flavors have a little time to blend. In a jar or bowl, combine the olive oil, red wine vinegar, Dijon, Italian seasoning, garlic powder, salt, and pepper. Whisk to combine, or close the jar and shake until combined. Set the dressing aside.
3. Add the cooking oil and minced garlic to a large pot or skillet. Sauté the garlic over medium heat for about one minute. Add the chopped kale and salt. Sauté for a few more minutes, or just until the kale is wilted. Set the kale aside.
4. Finally, prepare the rest of the toppings. Rinse and drain the white beans. Chop the sun dried tomatoes and walnuts. Crumble the feta.
5. When the rice has finished cooking, it's time to assemble the bowls. Add about ¾ cup rice to each bowl or container, followed by ½ cup sautéed kale, ⅓ cup beans, and a tablespoon each of sun dried tomatoes and walnuts. Sprinkle a little feta over each bowl. Divide the vinaigrette between four small containers. Refrigerate until ready to eat.
6. Reheat the bowls using a microwave just before serving, then drizzle with vinaigrette, stir, and enjoy!
