# Michelada

## Ingredients
- Tajin salt
- 2 ounces lime juice, from 2 limes
- 2 teaspoons Tapatio hot sauce
- 1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
- 1 12oz bottle of light Mexican beer ([Corona, Tecate, Modelo](./OtherCocktails.md)), well chilled


## Directions
1. Pour Taj√≠n (or other chili-salt mixture) or salt into a small, shallow dish in an even layer. Rub a pint or pilsner glass's rim with the cut side of the reserved juiced lime half, then dip glass into the dish to create a salt rim.
2. Set glass right side up and fill with lime juice, hot sauce, and Worcestershire sauce. Add a pinch or two of salt, fill glass with ice, and top with beer. Stir gently if you want to mix it up a bit. Serve with remaining beer, topping up as you drink.
