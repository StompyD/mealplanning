## Directions

1. In a large, heavy stock pot, melt butter over
medium heat. Add the bacon and cook, stirring
often, until bacon begins to crisp, about 8
minutes. Using a slotted spoon, remove bacon
from the pan and set aside.
2. Add celery, onions, jalapeños, scallions and
garlic and cook, stirring often, until softened,
about 8 minutes. Add the broth, potatoes, 1
teaspoon salt, pepper and cooked bacon. Bring
to a simmer and cook until the potatoes are
tender, about 15 minutes.
3. In a small bowl, whisk cornstarch and two
tablespoons of water to form a slurry. Stir the
cornstarch slurry into the broth and bring to a
boil. Let the soup boil for about 2 minutes to
thicken slightly.
4. Turn the heat down to a gentle simmer, and stir
in the corn and heavy cream. Place the salmon
pieces on top of the simmering soup, season it
with ½ teaspoon of salt, and cover the pot with a
lid. Simmer for ten minutes, or until the salmon
is cooked through.
5. Top with fresh chives or extra scallions and
freshly ground black pepper. Enjoy!
