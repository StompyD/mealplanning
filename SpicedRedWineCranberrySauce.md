## Ingredients 

- 12 ounces fresh or frozen cranberries
- 2/3 cup white sugar
- 2/3 cup dry red wine
- 3 tablespoons maple syrup
- 1 tablespoon molasses
- 1 teaspoon freshly grated ginger
- 1 teaspoon orange zest
- 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
- 1/8 teaspoon ground nutmeg
- 1/8 teaspoon ground allspice


## Directions
1. Combine cranberries, sugar, wine, syrup, molasses, ginger, orange zest, cinnamon, salt, nutmeg, and allspice in a medium saucepan. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Cook, stirring occasionally, until berries start to pop, about 5 minutes. Press berries against side of pan with wooden spoon and continue to cook until berries have broken down and sauce thickens to a jam-like consistency, about 5 minutes more. Remove from heat and let cool for 30 minutes. Adjust consistency with water as needed. Serve immediately or place in an airtight container and store in the refrigerator. Can be served cold or reheated.
