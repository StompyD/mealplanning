## Ingredients 

- 2 tablespoons chili powder
- 1 tablespoon whole cumin seeds, freshly toasted and ground
- 2 teaspoons cornstarch
- 2 teaspoons kosher salt
- 1 1/2 teaspoons hot smoked paprika
- 1 teaspoon ground coriander
- 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper


## Directions
1. Put all the ingredients in a small jar and shake to combine. Store in an airtight container for up to 1 month.
2. To use, break up a half pound of ground beef or turkey in a wide skillet over medium heat. As soon as it starts to sizzle, sprinkle on a tablespoon or two and continue stirring. As moisture cooks out of the meat and simmers, it will be thickened by the cornstarch. Itâ€™s a darned tasty trick.
