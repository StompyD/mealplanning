# Ingredients
- 1 whole lime juiced
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1/2 cup good-quality mayonnaise (such as Hellmann's)
- 3 ounces queso fresco or blanco
- 2 serrano peppers ends trimmed
- 1 bunch cilantro with the leaves removed and stems discarded*
- 4 garlic cloves peeled
- 2 green onions ends trimmed and roughly chopped
- 1 tablespoon aji amarillo paste (optional)
- 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt


# Directions
1. To a blender, add the lime juice, olive oil, cheese, mayonnaise, serrano peppers, cilantro leaves, garlic cloves, green onions, huacatay paste, aji amarillo and salt. Blend for about 1 to 2 minutes, until very smooth. At first the cilantro leaves won't be totally smooth, but keep the blender running and it will eventually become cohesive and smooth.
2. Give it a taste and adjust the salt according to your liking. Keeps in the fridge for up to a week.
