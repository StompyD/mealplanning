## Ingredients 

- 2 ½ cups (325g) all-purpose flour, spooned and leveled (plus extra for rolling)
- 1 tbsp (14g) granulated sugar
- 1 tsp coarse Kosher salt (if using table salt, use half the amount)
- 1 cup (226g) cold unsalted butter, diced
- 2 tsp (10g) apple cider vinegar
- 6-8 tbsp (100-135ml) cold whole milk

## Directions

1. In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, sugar and salt.  Scatter the butter over the flour and use a pastry cutter to cut the butter into smaller chunks, about 1/4 inch in size.  Now use your fingers and smash each chunk of butter flat.
- Baker's Note: You can also combine the flour, sugar, salt and butter in a food processor, until crumbly and moistened.
2. Drizzle the apple cider vinegar and milk over the flour mixture and toss to combine.  Dump the mixture out onto a clean work surface, and use your hands to gather the crumbs together.  Keep gathering and pressing the crumbs together until it comes together into a ball – this should only take a minute or two.  Use your bench scraper to scrape all the bits of dough off the work surface, if any of it sticks.  Divide the dough into two portions, and just work with one portion at a time.
3. Lightly flour your work surface, the ball of dough, and your rolling pin.  Roll the dough out, using using your bench scraper to loosen the dough from your work surface, and sprinkling more flour as needed to keep it from sticking, into a rough circle about 1/4 inch thick.  There may be a few cracks in the dough, and you should see visible chunks of butter throughout.
4. Fold the dough into thirds, like a letter, and then in thirds again, so you have a neat little package of dough.  Wrap in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for about 20 minutes, to let the dough rest and chill.  Repeat the rolling and folding step with the second portion of dough.
5. After chilling the dough for 20 minutes, it’s ready to be rolled out for your pie.  Flour your work surface again, and roll the dough out, using more flour as needed to keep it from sticking, until large enough to fit into your pie pan with a little overhang.  You’ll notice that the dough, after being folded and chilled, rolls out into a much smoother dough that’s strong enough to be cut into lattice strips or other decorative cutouts, as well.
6. Your pie dough is now ready to be filled and baked.

## Notes

If not needed immediately, the dough can be refrigerated for up to two days, or wrapped well and frozen for several months, until you’re ready to use it.  Frozen dough should be thawed overnight in the refrigerator, and then allowed to warm up at room temperature until easy enough to handle, although still cool.
