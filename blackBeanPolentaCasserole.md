## Ingredients

- 3 1/2 cups cooked polenta
- 1 Tablespoon butter or light olive oil
- 6–8 ounces shredded cheese, divided
- 1 teaspoon minced garlic (about 1 clove)
- 1/3 cup onion, finely diced*
- 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
- 1/2 teaspoon chili powder
- 2 eggs
- 2 cans (10 ounces) Ro*Tel® Original Diced Tomatoes & Green Chiles, drained 
- 3 cans (15 ounces) black beans, drained and rinsed
- 1/2 teaspoon cumin
- 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1/8 –1/4 teaspoon cayenne
- 1/2 teaspoon black pepper
- Optional Garnishes/Toppings- chopped cilantro, sliced avocado, sour cream, sliced jalapeños

## Directions 

1. Preheat the oven to 350 F. Coat a 9×13 pan with olive oil or nonstick cooking oil spray and set aside.
2. In a large pot, cook the polenta according to package instructions. (For this recipe I'll normally use 1 cup dry corn meal with 4 cups of chicken stock.) When polenta is almost done cooking, stir in butter and 4 ounces of shredded cheese until creamy.
3. Saute garlic and onions in oil or butter with salt, pepper, and chili powder. Stir in the cooked garlic and onion with salt and chili powder with the polenta. Crack 2 eggs into the mixture. Mix thoroughly.
4. Transfer polenta mixture into the 9×13 pan and spread until even, reaching each corner. If polenta is too runny or moist, parbake it at 350F for 15 minutes, then add the rest of your layers and bake again.
5. In a medium-sized bowl, stir together the black beans, cumin, garlic powder, cayenne, and black pepper. Evenly distribute the black beans on top of the polenta.
6. Layer the tomatoes and green chiles over the black beans.
7. Finally, add the remaining shredded cheese evenly on top of the tomatoes and green chiles. Add more than 2 oz, if desired.
8. Bake for 30 minutes or until the edges start to brown.
9. Then cover with aluminum foil and bake for an additional 5 -10 minutes or until the center of the casserole is baked through and edges are golden brown.
10. If desired, broil until the edges and cheese are browned and crispy. Remove from the oven and let cool for 5 minutes before slicing.
11. Add optional toppings when plating.
12. Store leftovers in the refrigerator for up to 4 days.
