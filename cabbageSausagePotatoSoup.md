[Recipe Link](https://www.gimmesomeoven.com/cabbage-sausage-potato-soup/)

## Ingredients
- 1 pound kielbasa sausage*, sliced into bite-sized pieces
- 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
- 3 medium leeks, sliced into ⅛ inch rounds, white and pale green parts only
- 2 medium carrots, peeled and diced
- 1 stalk celery, diced
- 1 small green cabbage, chopped into bite-sized pieces
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 6 cups chicken or vegetable stock
- 1 pound red potatoes, diced
- 1 tablespoon Italian seasoning, homemade or store-bought
- 1 bay leaf
- Kosher salt and freshly-cracked black pepper

## Directions
1. Add sausage to a large stockpot and cook over medium-heat for 5-6 minutes, stirring and flipping occasionally, until the sausage is lightly browned.  Use a slotted spoon to transfer the sausage to a separate plate, and set aside.
2. Add the olive oil, leeks, carrots and celery to the pan, and stir to combine.  Sauté for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Then add the cabbage and garlic, and sauté for 4 more minutes, stirring occasionally.
3. Add the stock, potatoes, Italian seasoning, bay leaf, cooked sausage, and stir to combine. Continue cooking until the soup reaches a simmer.  Then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer for 15 minutes, or until the potatoes are cooked and tender.
4. Remove and discard the bay leaf.  Taste and season with a few generous pinches of salt and black pepper as needed.  (Also, depending on how seasoned your sausage is, feel free to stir in a extra few teaspoons of Italian seasoning if you think it needs some extra flavor.  A pinch of crushed red pepper flakes will also help bring out the flavors.)
5. Serve warm.  Or refrigerate in sealed containers for up to 3 days, or freeze for up to 3 months.
