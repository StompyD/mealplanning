## Ingredients
- 1 pound jalapeno peppers
- 16 peeled garlic cloves
- 1/3 cup canola oil, plus more for drizzling on peppers and garlic
- 1/4 cup fresh cilantro leaves
- 1â€“2 teaspoons salt, depending on preference

## Directions
1. Turn on the broiler. 
2. Toss the jalapeno peppers in a little oil, then place in a single layer on a baking sheet. Broil until mostly blackened and soft, about 10-12 minutes, flipping the peppers halfway through cooking time to get all sides cooked.
3. Place the peppers in a bowl and cover with plastic wrap to steam. Let sit for 10 minutes.
4. Meanwhile, toss the garlic cloves with a little oil and place on the baking sheet you just used. 5. Put back in the oven and broil for 4-5 minutes until browned (not burnt! Burnt garlic will ruin the entire dish)
6. When the jalapenos have cooled down, remove the skins (they should just peel off) and the seeds. See the commentary above for how many seeds to keep; I like 1/2 seeded and 1/2 kept for a spicy sauce. For a milder version, remove all of the seeds.
7. Place the peeled jalapenos and seeds (as using) along with the garlic, cilantro and 1 teaspoon salt in the base of a high-powered blender. Puree until mostly combined, then slowly drizzle in the oil to form a smooth and creamy sauce. Season to taste, adding more salt as needed. If you want a thinner sauce, add in a few tablespoons of water.
