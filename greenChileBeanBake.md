## Ingredients

- 1 tablespoon neutral oil (such as grapeseed)
- 2 poblano chiles or green bell peppers, seeds and stem removed, coarsely chopped
- Salt and pepper
- 2(15-ounce) cans pinto beans, rinsed
- 1(16-ounce) jar salsa verde, or 1¾ cups homemade salsa verde
- ¼ cup packed cilantro leaves, stems reserved and finely chopped
- 1½ cups/6 ounces grated Monterey Jack cheese
- Lime wedges, for serving

## Directions
1. Arrange a rack in the upper third of the oven and heat the broiler to high. (If you don’t have a broiler, see Tip.)
2. In a large, ovenproof skillet, heat the oil over medium-high. Add the poblanos and cook, undisturbed, until browned underneath, 2 to 3 minutes. Season with salt and pepper and cook, stirring occasionally, until crisp-tender, 2 to 3 minutes.
3. Stir in the beans, salsa verde and cilantro stems, and simmer until thickened slightly, 2 to 3 minutes.
4. Turn off the heat, sprinkle the cheese evenly over the top, then broil until melted and browned in spots, 2 to 3 minutes. Serve right away topped with cilantro leaves and a squeeze of lime.

## TIP
You can also melt the cheese on the stovetop. Set the heat under the skillet to low, cover the skillet, and cook until the cheese is melted, 2 to 4 minutes.
