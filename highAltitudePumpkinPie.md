## Ingredients 
### Crust
- ½ recipe [All Butter Pie Dough](./allButterPieDough.md) (1 single pie crust)

### Filling
- 1 can (15 oz) pumpkin (not pumpkin pie filling)
- 1 cup heavy whipping cream or half and half
- ¾ cup light brown sugar, lightly packed
- 2 large eggs
- 2 tsp vanilla extract
- ¼ tsp ground cinnamon
- ¼ tsp ground ginger
- ¼ tsp ground cloves
- ¼ tsp ground nutmeg
- ¼ tsp coarse Kosher salt (if using table salt, use half the amount)

## Directions
### Crust
1. Prepare 1/2 Recipe Pie Dough (or make the full recipe, and freeze half the dough for another pie).
2. Roll the dough out into a circle, and fit it into your pie pan. Fold the edges under and crimp the edges. Freeze the crust for 30 minutes.
3. Preheat the oven to 400 F, with one rack positioned in the center and one rack positioned in the lower third of the oven.
4. Lay a piece of parchment paper over the frozen crust, and fill with dried beans or pie weights.
5. Bake the crust on the center oven rack for 20 minutes. Remove the beans and the paper from the crust, then return the crust to the oven and bake for another 10-15 minutes, until it's a pale golden brown. If the bottom of the crust puffs up a little, just gently press it flat again with a spoon. Set the crust aside while you make the filling.
6. Reduce the oven temperature to 325 F.

### Filling
1. In a bowl, whisk together all of the filling ingredients until smooth. Pour the filling into the pre-baked crust.
2. Bake the pie on the lower oven rack at 325 F for about 50-60 minutes. You'll know the pie is done when the edges are gently puffed and set but the center of the pie (around 4-5 inches across) is still wobbly when you gently shake the pan. If the center is puffed and set or the filling is cracking, then you've over-baked your pie.
3. Set the pie on a cooling rack to cool at room temperature for two hours, then refrigerate for two more hours before serving. The filling will set up as the pie cools.
4. Decorate the top of the pie with pie crust cutouts and serve with whipped cream.
