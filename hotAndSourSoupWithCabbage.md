## Ingredients

- 1 tablespoon canola oil
- 4 ounces cremini or shiitake mushroom caps, thinly sliced
- 1 to 3 jalape√±o peppers, finely diced
- 6 cloves garlic, minced
- 3-inch piece ginger, grated (or 1 tablespoon ginger puree)
- 1 to 3 limes, zested and juiced
- 8 cups chicken broth (or turkey or vegetable)
- 1/2 cup jasmine rice
- 2 tablespoons soy sauce (or tamari, if gluten-free), plus more to serve
- 1/2 small head green cabbage, cut in half and shaved thin
- Chili garlic sauce or kimchi, to serve


## Directions 

1. Heat the oil in a large heavy pot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add the mushrooms and cook for 5 minutes without stirring. Stir the mushrooms after 5 minutes and cook for 5 more minutes, or until well-browned. Add the diced peppers, garlic, and ginger and cook for about 5 minutes, or until fragrant and slightly softened.
2. Add the lime zest and broth and bring to a simmer. Add the rice, cover, and simmer for about 20 minutes, or until the rice is just barely soft. Add the shaved cabbage, lime juice, and soy sauce and simmer for another few minutes, or until cabbage is hot. Taste and add more lime juice, soy sauce, or other seasonings to taste.
3. Serve with extra soy sauce, lime wedges, and kimchi or chili garlic sauce.
