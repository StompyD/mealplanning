## Ingredients

- 1lb/450g 80/20 ground chuck 
- 8oz/225g hot italian pork sausage (I use 2 links) 
- 200g or 1 med-lrg onion, medium diced 
- 20g or 4 cloves garlic, minced/pressed 
- Coarse salt 
- 1g or 1/2tsp dried oregano 
- 1g or 1/2tsp red chili flake 
- 75g or 1/3c tomato paste 
- 15g or 1Tbsp beef better than bouillon 
- 28oz/800g can crushed tomatoes 
- 28oz/800g water (enough water to fill tomato can) 
- 7-8g or 2tsp granulated sugar 
- 10g or 3Tbsp fresh basil, chopped 
- 12oz/340g dried spaghetti (broken in half) 
- 50g or 1/2c grated parmesan + extra for garnish 


## Directions 

1. Preheat your oven to 425F/220C.
2. Heat a dutch oven or large heavy bottomed pot over medium high. Add a bit of oil, the ground beef, and sausage, breaking the meat apart into small pieces as it cooks - i use a meat smasher for this. 
3. When the meat begins to brown and is well broken down, stir in the onion, garlic, and a pinch of salt, making sure to scrape up any meat fond stuck to the bottom of the pot. Cover and cook for 5 minutes.
4. After 5 minutes of cooking, stir in oregano, chile flake, and tomato paste and cook for a minute or so until tomato paste is well incorporated. 
5. Stir in bouillon and can of crushed tomatoes, water, 6-8g/1.5tsp salt, 7-8g/2tsp sugar and bring to a simmer. 
6. Stir in basil. Add in spaghetti and gently stir and press down to submerge noodles. Simmer for about 60 seconds. 
7. Carefully stir noodles again to fully submerge noodles. Transfer the pot to the oven to cook, uncovered for 16-18 min, gently stirring and submerging at 5 and 10 minutes into cooking.
8. Taste for doneness and seasoning and adjust if necessary. Stir in grated parm. 
9. Garnish with additional parm.
