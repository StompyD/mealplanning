## Ingredients
- 4 cups water
- 1/2 tsp. salt
- 1 1/4 cups yellow cornmeal
- 3 cans (15 oz. each) vegetarian chili with beans
- 1 pkg. (16 oz.) frozen mixed vegetables, thawed and well drained

## Instructions
1. Prehaet oven to 350. In a large heavy saucepan bring water and salt to a boil. Reduce heat to a gentle boil; slowly whisk in cornmeal. Cook and stir with a wooden spoon until polenta is thickened and pulls away cleanly from side of pan, 15-20 minutes.
2. Remove from heat. Stir in 1/4 cup cheddar cheese until melted.
3. Spread into a 13x9 in baking dish coated with cooking spray. Bake, uncovered, 20 minutes. Meanwhile heat chili according to package directions.
4. Spread vegetables over polenta; top with chili. Sprinkle with the remaining cheese. Bake until cheese is melted, 12-15 minutes longer. Let stand 10 minutes before serving.
