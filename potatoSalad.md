## Ingredients

- 1 pound (16 ounces) uncooked pasta (I used linguine)
- 5 lb. Russet Potatoes (about 8 Medium Russets)
- 1 1/2 c. Real Mayonnaise (NOT Miracle Whip)
- 4 Tbsp. Prepared Mustard (regular, Dijon Or A Mixture Of Both)
- 5 whole Green Onions, Sliced Up To The Darkest Green Part
- 8 whole Small Sweet Pickles (may Use Dill If That's More Up Your Alley)
- 1 tsp. Kosher Salt (more To Taste)
- 1/2 tsp. Paprika
- 1/2 tsp. Black Pepper
- 4 whole Hard Boiled Eggs
- 4 Slices Bacon, fried and crumbled

## Directions

1. Cut potatoes in halves or thirds, then boil until fork tender. Drain. Mash potatoes or run them through a ricer or food mill to make them extra fluffy. Fold potatoes together with mayonnaise, mustard, green onions, salt, pepper, and other seasonings you like. Fold in pickles, eggs, and bacon, then taste for seasonings, adding more salt, mustard, or mayo as needed. You may also splash in juice from the pickle jar if salad needs a little moisture.
