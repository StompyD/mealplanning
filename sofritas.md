## Ingredients

- 1 (14- to 16-ounce) package extra-firm tofu
- 1 medium poblano pepper
- 1 tablespoon plus 2 teaspoons olive oil, divided
- 1 small yellow onion
- 2 cloves garlic
- 1 canned chipotle pepper in adobo sauce
- 2 tablespoons tomato paste
- 1 tablespoon canned adobo sauce
- 1 tablespoon red wine vinegar
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
- 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt, divided
- 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- 3/4 cup water, divided

## Instructions

1. Arrange an oven rack 6 inches below the broiler and turn the oven to broil.
Drain a 14- to 16-ounce block of tofu. Wrap the tofu in a few layers of paper towels, then set on a dinner plate. Weigh it down with a heavy object such as a skillet, pot, or large can, and let sit for at least 15 minutes to drain. Meanwhile, broil the pepper and make the sauce.

2. Cut 1 poblano pepper in half lengthwise, and remove and discard the stem and seeds. Place the pepper on a baking sheet, drizzle with 2 teaspoons of the olive oil, and toss to coat. Broil until charred all over, flipping halfway through, about 10 minutes total. Cool slightly.

3. Coarsely chop 1 small yellow onion. Place the onion, poblano pepper, 2 garlic cloves, 1 canned chipotle pepper, 2 tablespoons tomato paste, 1 tablespoon adobo sauce, 1 tablespoon red wine vinegar, 1 teaspoon ground cumin, 1/2 teaspoon dried oregano, 1 teaspoon of the kosher salt, 1/4 teaspoon black pepper, and 1/2 cup of the water in the bowl of a food processor fitted with the blade attachment. Process until smooth, about 2 minutes.

4. Pat the tofu dry with towels. Crumble into small curds with your hands into a medium bowl. Heat the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add the tofu, season with the remaining 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, and cook, stirring occasionally, until golden brown around the edges, about 8 minutes.

5. Pour the sauce into the skillet and stir to combine. Reduce the heat to low and simmer for 5 minutes. Stir in the remaining 1/4 cup water, scrape the bottom of the skillet, and cook, stirring occasionally, until the flavors meld, about 5 minutes more.
