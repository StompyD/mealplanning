# Ingredients
- ½ cup (4 ounces) cream cheese
- 1½ cups sushi or Calrose rice  
- ¼ cup rice vinegar 
- 1½ tablespoons granulated sugar
- 1teaspoon kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal)
- Toasted sesame oil, for greasing
- ⅓ cup furikake rice seasoning
- 1 pound imitation crab, thawed if frozen, finely chopped
- ½ cup plus ⅓ cup Kewpie mayonnaise, or regular mayonnaise
- Sriracha, to taste (optional)
- Chopped scallions, for topping (optional)
- Diced avocado, sliced cucumber, nori sheets (cut into 3-inch squares) and unagi sauce, for serving (optional)


# Directions
1. Place the cream cheese in a large mixing bowl and set aside to come to room temperature.
2. Prepare the rice: In a fine-mesh strainer, rinse the rice until the water runs clear and transfer to a medium pot or saucepan with a lid. Cover with 2 cups of water and soak for 15 minutes. Bring the rice to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce to low, cover and cook for 15 to 20 minutes, depending on the rice, until tender and the water has been absorbed. Remove from the heat and let sit, covered, for 10 minutes. (Alternatively, you can use a rice cooker.)
3. Meanwhile, add the vinegar, sugar and salt to a small saucepan over medium heat. Simmer, stirring, until the sugar and salt dissolve, about 3 minutes. Transfer the rice to a large mixing bowl. Pour the vinegar mixture evenly on top and fold it into the rice.
4. Heat oven to 375 degrees with the rack in the middle position. Grease the bottom of a 9-by-13-inch casserole dish with sesame oil.
5. Transfer the rice to the casserole dish, using damp hands to spread it an even layer. Sprinkle on half of the furikake seasoning.
6. Add the crab, ½ cup mayo and sriracha, if using, to the bowl with the cream cheese, then mix well to combine. Evenly spread the crab mixture on top of the rice in the casserole, then sprinkle on the remaining furikake.
7. In a small bowl, combine the remaining ⅓ cup mayo and sriracha, if using, for the topping. Spoon the mixture on the casserole, or transfer it to a small, resealable plastic bag and snip the corner to pipe it onto the dish.
8. Bake, uncovered, until everything is gently bubbling, 25 to 30 minutes. Remove from the oven and let rest for at least 10 minutes before slicing. Serve with nori and toppings of choice.
