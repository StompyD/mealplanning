## Ingredients

### Soup
- 1/2 Tbsp coconut or olive oil
- 1 medium white onion (diced)
- 4 cloves garlic minced
- 1 large sweet potato (peeled & cubed)
- 2 Tbsp yellow curry powder
- 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper (omit for less heat)
- 3/4 tsp sea salt , plus more to taste
- 3 cups light coconut milk (canned is best)

### Spicy Baked Chickpeas
- 1 15-oz. can chickpeas (1 can yields ~1 1/2 cups)
- 3 Tbsp avocado or coconut oil
- 1/2 tsp yellow curry powder
- 1/4 tsp sea salt
- 1/2 tsp garlic powder
- 1/2 tsp ginger powder
- 1 pinch cayenne pepper

## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (204 C).
2. In the meantime, start the soup by sweating the onions in a large pot over medium heat in 1/2 Tbsp coconut (or olive/avocado) oil (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size). Cook for a few minutes and then add garlic and stir.
3. Season with 1/4 tsp each salt and pepper and stir (amount salt/pepper as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size). Add sweet potatoes, curry powder, and cayenne pepper (reduce or omit for less heat).
4. Cook for 5 minutes, stirring frequently.
5. Add 1/4 tsp more salt and the coconut milk (amount salt/pepper as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size). Then cover.
6. Bring to a simmer and then reduce heat to low. Simmer for 25 minutes more.
7. In the meantime, prep your baked chickpeas by rinsing, draining, and toweling off until dry. Then toss in oil and spices and spreading evenly on a baking sheet. Bake for 25-30 minutes or until crispy on the outside and slightly soft on the inside. Remove and set aside for serving.
8. At the end of 25 minutes, taste and adjust seasonings as needed. I added about 1/4 tsp more salt and a pinch more cayenne pepper. Then puree using an immersion blender or blender. Transfer back to the pot if needed and keep heat on low until ready to serve. Garnish with baked chickpeas.
9. Will keep in the fridge for several days and the freezer for a month or so.
