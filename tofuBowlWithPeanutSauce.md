Author: Cookie and Kate

## Ingredients

### Base Ingredients

- 1/4 cups brown rice, preferably Arborio (short-grain), rinsed
- 16 ounces broccoli florets(from about 2 medium bunches), cut into bite- size pieces 
- 1 red bell pepper, cut into 1-inch squares
- 2 tablespoons extra- virgin olive oil
- Extra-Crispy Baked Tofu (1 pound)

### Peanut Sauce Ingredients
- 1/4 cup creamy peanut butter
- 2 tablespoons reduced- sodium tamari or soy sauce
- 1 tablespoon rice vinegar
- 1 tablespoon honey
- 2 teaspoons toasted sesame oil 
- 1 clove garlic, pressed or minced
- Pinch of red pepper flakes
- 1 to 2 tablespoons water, or more as needed


## Directions 
1. Preheat the oven to 400Â°F with a rack in the upper third of the oven.

2. Bring a large pot of water to boil. Add the rice and boil for 30 minutes. Drain the rice, return to the pot, cover, and let it rest for 5 minutes off the heat.

3. Meanwhile, on a large rimmed baking sheet, combine the broccoli florets and bell pepper and drizzle them with the olive oil. Toss until they're lightly and evenly coated in oil. Arrange the broccoli and bell pepper in an even layer, with the flat sides lying against the pan for maximum caramelization. Sprinkle lightly with salt.

4. Bake the veggies on the upper rack until the broccoli is deeply golden on the edges, 25 to 30 minutes, tossing halfway through. 5. To make the sauce: In a small bowl, combine the peanut butter, tamari, vinegar, honey, sesame oil, garlic, and pepper flakes. Whisk until blended, then whisk in 1 to 2 tablespoons water, or as much as necessary to reach a thick but drizzly consistency.

6. Before assembling, uncover the rice, add 1/4 teaspoon salt, and use a fork to fluff the rice. Spoon the rice into individual bowls and top with plenty of roasted veggies and tofu. Drizzle the peanut sauce on top. Finish each bowl with a sprinkle of chopped peanuts and cilantro. Serve with Sriracha on the side.

7. Store leftover peanut sauce separately from any remaining rice, veggies, or tofu. Extra sauce makes a great dip for raw vegetables. Leftovers will keep well, chilled, for up to 4 days.
