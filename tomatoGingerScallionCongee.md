## Ingredients 
- 4 scallions, finely diced
- 4 garlic cloves, thinly sliced
- 5 thin slices of ginger, size of thumb
- 12 oz grape tomatoes (or cherry when in season)
- 5 cups chicken broth
- 4 teaspoons kosher salt 
- 3 teaspoons brown sugar 
- 2 teaspoons sesame oil 
- 1/2 cup white rice 

## Directions
1. In a large pot, heat a generous drizzle of oil on medium heat. Add in scallions, garlic, and ginger and saut√© for 30 seconds until sizzling and fragrant. Add tomatoes and continue to cook until they've softened and look wrinkly, around 6-8 minutes. With a spatula, smash the tomatoes and allow the juices to release and simmer for another minute or so. Add in chicken broth, kosher salt, brown sugar, sesame oil, and white rice.

2. Bring the entire pot to a boil, then bring the heat down to low to reduce to a very gentle simmer. Cover with a lid and cook for 1 hour (stir frequently and scrape the bottom every 10 min so it doesn't burn on the bottom) until the water has reduced and the consistency resembles a creamy porridge. Once cooked, ladle into bowls and add extra scallions and enjoy warm!
