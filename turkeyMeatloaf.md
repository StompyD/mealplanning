- 3 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce

## Instructions
1. Preheat the oven to 350°F with a rack in the center position. Line a rimmed sheet pan with parchment paper or foil.

4. Make the glaze
5. In a small bowl, combine the brown sugar, 1 tablespoon Worcestershire, and 1 tablespoon tomato paste until smooth.

8. Bake until the internal temperature reaches 165°F on an instant-read thermometer, about 50 minutes.
