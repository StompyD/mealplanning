Note: Serves 6

## Ingredients
- 12 oz. medium shell pasta or pasta of choice
- 1 lb. (16 oz.) ground turkey
- 3 Tbsp. olive oil
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1/2 large red bell pepper, diced small
- 4 oz. white mushrooms, thinly sliced or diced small
- 1/2 large white onion, diced
- 1 tsp. salt (taste and add more as desired)
- 1/2 tsp. pepper
- 1 tsp. Italian seasoning
- 2 Tbsp. all purpose flour
- 2 cups beef broth (or chicken broth)
- 1, (15oz.) can tomato sauce
- 1 cup heavy cream
- 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese, freshly grated
- Fresh basil for garnish (optional)

## Instructions
1. Boil the water for the pasta and follow directions on the shell pasta box. Typically 8-10 minutes to cook medium shells.
2. In a Dutch oven or wide stock pot, heat 2 Tbsp. of the olive oil over medium heat and cook the ground turkey. Season the ground turkey with salt and pepper. Once cooked, drain excess fat/liquid in the pan and place the ground turkey in a bowl and set aside.
3. Then, add the remaining tablespoon of olive oil to the same pan. Saut√© the garlic, bell peppers, mushrooms, and onions with salt, pepper, and Italian seasoning until fragrant (about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally). Then, whisk in the flour until combined.
4. Pour in the beef broth and tomato sauce and let it come to a simmer. Then add in the cooked ground turkey.
5. Pour in the cooked shells or pasta of choice, heavy cream, and Parmesan. Stir to combine.
6. Taste and adjust salt and pepper or other seasonings as desired. It may seem soupy initially; just simmer and stir occasionally until the sauce thickens. If you would like it creamier, add more heavy cream. Garnish with fresh basil and more Parmesan cheese and enjoy! The pasta will keep in the refrigerator for 3-4 days.
