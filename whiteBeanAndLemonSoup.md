## Ingredients

- 2 (15-oz.) cans cannellini beans, rinsed and drained
- 4 cups lower-sodium vegetable broth divided
- 2 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil
- 1 yellow onion finely chopped
- 2 large carrots finely chopped
- 1 tsp. each salt and cracked black pepper
- 4 garlic cloves minced
- 1 (15-oz.) can chickpeas, rinsed and drained
- 1 Tbsp. finely chopped fresh rosemary
- 1 small bunch escarole, roughly chopped (sub lacinato kale or chard)
- Zest and juice of 1 lemon
- â…“ cup grated Parmesan cheese plus more for garnish


## Directions 

1. Combine 1 can of cannellini beans and 1 cup of broth in a blender; blend until completely smooth. Set aside.
2. Heat oil in a large stockpot or Dutch oven over medium. Add onions and carrots; cook until softened, stirring occasionally, about 7 or 8 minutes. Add garlic; cook 1 to 2 more minutes. Add remaining can of cannellini beans, chickpeas, and rosemary; stir to combine, and cook for 1 minute.
3. Stir in blended bean and broth mixture, remaining 3 cups broth, chopped escarole, salt, and black pepper. Bring mixture to a boil; reduce to a simmer and cook, uncovered, 20 to 25 minutes, or until soup slightly thickens.
4. Stir in lemon zest and juice. Gradually sprinkle in Parmesan cheese, stirring continuously (don't add it all at once or it may clump).
5. Ladle soup into bowls, and garnish with additional Parmesan cheese, cracked black pepper, and chopped rosemary, if desired. Serve with crusty bread.
