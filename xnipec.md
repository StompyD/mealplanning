## Ingredients
- 1 small red onion
- 2 tablespoons fresh-squeezed lime juice
- 10 ounces ripe tomatoes
- 6 radishes
- 1/2 whole habanero chile – or more (we used 1 whole)
- 12 large fresh cilantro sprigs
- 1/2 teaspoon salt

## Instructions
1. Chop the onion very finely, using a knife (don’t use a food processor), and scoop it into a strainer; rinse under cold water. Shake as much of the water off as possible, then transfer to a small bowl and stir in the juice. Set aside.
2. Core the tomatoes, then cut in half crosswise; squeeze out the seeds. Finely dice the tomatoes (about 1/4 inch cubes). Scoop into a bowl.
3. Slice the radishes 1/16-inch thick, then chop into matchsticks or small dice. Add to the tomatoes.
4. Put on a pair of rubber gloves. Carefully cut out and discard the habanero’s seed pod, then mince the flesh into tiny bits and add to the tomatoes.
5. Bunch up the cilantro sprigs, and, with a very sharp knife, slice them 1/16-inch thick, stems and all, working from the leafy end toward the stems.
6. Combine radishes, chile, and chopped cilantro with the tomato mixture; stir in the onion and juice mixture. Taste and season with salt.
