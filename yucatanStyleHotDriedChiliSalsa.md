## Ingredients 
- 1 ounce dried chiles de árbol (30g; about 25 dried chiles) (see notes)
- 1 ounce dried chiles pasillas (30g; 3 to 4 whole chiles) (see notes)
- 1/4 cup fresh juice from 4 to 5 limes (2 ounces; 60ml) (see notes)
- 1/4 cup fresh juice from 1 grapefruit (2 ounces; 60ml) (see notes)
- 1/4 cup fresh juice from 1 orange (2 ounces; 60ml) (see notes)
- Salt

## Instructions
1.Use kitchen shears to trim stems from all chilies. Discard stems. Place chilies on a microwave-safe plate and microwave on high power until fragrant and pliable, about 20 seconds total, adding time in 5-second increments if chilies do not smell toasted after the initial 20.
2. Combine chilies, lime juice, grapefruit juice, and orange juice in the jar of a blender with a small pinch of salt. Blend at high speed until smooth. Transfer to a bowl, let rest for 15 to 20 minutes, then stir in more salt to taste. Salsa can be stored in a sealed container in the refrigerator for several weeks.

## Notes
This salsa is typically made with chiles país, which are not widely available outside of the Yucatán. I use a combination of chiles de árbol and chiles pasillas in their place. If you can find bitter oranges (Seville oranges), use 3/4 cup fresh bitter-orange juice in place of the lime, orange, and grapefruit juice combo.
